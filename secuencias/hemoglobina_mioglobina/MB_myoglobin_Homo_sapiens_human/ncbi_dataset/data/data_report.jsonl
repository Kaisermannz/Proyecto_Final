The encoded protein forms a monomeric globular haemoprotein that is primarily responsible for the storage and facilitated transfer of oxygen from the cell membrane to the mitochondria. This protein also plays a role in regulating physiological levels of nitric oxide. Multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms exist for this gene.
